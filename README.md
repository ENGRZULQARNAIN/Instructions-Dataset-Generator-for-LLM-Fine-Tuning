## Instructions Dataset Generator for LLM Fine-Tuning

### Overview
This repository contains the tools and scripts necessary to create a custom instructions dataset for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the capabilities of Google Gemini and LangChain, our solution is designed to cater specifically to your unique use cases. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the development of tailored instruction sets that enhance LLM performance in specific tasks or domains.

### Features
- Data Collection: Scripts to automate the gathering of relevant data from specified sources.
- Data Processing: Utilities for cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to ensure high-quality datasets.
- Instruction Generation: Implementation of a robust framework using Google Gemini for generating precise and contextually appropriate instructions.
- Integration with LangChain: Utilize LangChain to seamlessly incorporate generated instructions into LLM workflows, enabling efficient fine-tuning processes.

### Getting Started
